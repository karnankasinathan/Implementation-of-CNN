# Implementation-of-CNN

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for digit classification.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.(http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/index.html)

## DESIGN STEPS

### Step 1:
Load the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits and corresponding labels.

### Step 2:
Reshape and normalize the images by scaling the pixel values between 0 and 1.

### Step 3:
Define a CNN model using layers such as convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Add a softmax output layer for classification.

### Step 4:
Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam), loss function (e.g., categorical crossentropy), and evaluation metric (accuracy).

### Step 5:
Train the model on the training dataset for a fixed number of epochs (e.g., 10 epochs) while monitoring the validation accuracy using early stopping to halt training once a desired accuracy is achieved.

### Step 6:
Stop training if the model reaches 98% accuracy on the training set to prevent overfitting and save computation time.
